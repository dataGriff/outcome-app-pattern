The application must be accompanied by a report that demonstrates the number of clicks and colour generated.


## Stories

As an application user, I want to see a random red, amber or green colour displayed on the screen when I click a button, so that I can discover new colours.

As a decision maker, I want to see a count of how many times the button has been clicked, so that I can track the number of interactions with the application.
